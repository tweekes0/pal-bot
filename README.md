# Pal Bot

Pal Bot is a discord bot leverages 
the [discordgo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo) library to create sound clips from Youtube videos and play them within your discord server. This bot is heavily inspired by [Beginbot's](https://www.twitch.tv/beginbot) sound command that allows viewers to create sound bites and have them play on stream.
